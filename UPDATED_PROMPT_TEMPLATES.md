# UPDATED AI DEVELOPMENT PROMPT TEMPLATES
*Incorporating Latest Research from Anthropic, Google, and Kaggle*

## ðŸš€ BREAKTHROUGH UPDATES FROM RESEARCH

### NEW: PTCF Framework (Google Research)
**Revolutionary Discovery**: The most effective prompts use this 4-component structure:
- **P**ersona: Clear role assignment with expertise level
- **T**ask: Specific action verb + clear objective  
- **C**ontext: Background information and constraints
- **F**ormat: Desired output structure

### NEW: Chain of Thought (CoT) Integration 
**Research Finding**: CoT improves accuracy by 20-40% for complex tasks
- Always put reasoning BEFORE final answer
- Use temperature 0.0 for reasoning tasks
- Include "Let's think step by step" for zero-shot CoT

### NEW: Positive Instructions > Constraints
**Critical Update**: Positive instructions outperform negative constraints by 15-25%
- DO: "Generate clean, well-documented code with error handling"
- DON'T: "Don't write messy code. Don't forget error handling. Don't use bad practices."

## ðŸ”¥ ENHANCED CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. PTCF Structure (MANDATORY)
Every prompt MUST follow this order:
```
PERSONA: You are a [specific role] with [expertise] specializing in [domain]...
TASK: [Action verb] [specific objective] that [measurable outcome]...
CONTEXT: [Background] [constraints] [requirements]...
FORMAT: Return response as [structure] with [specific elements]...
```

### 2. Chain of Thought Integration
For complex tasks, always include:
```
REASONING: Let's approach this step by step:
1. First, analyze [aspect 1]
2. Then, evaluate [aspect 2]  
3. Finally, synthesize [final step]
```

### 3. JSON-First Output (NEW)
For structured tasks, request JSON output:
- Reduces hallucinations by 25%
- Enables programmatic processing
- Forces logical structure

### 4. Advanced Few-Shot Strategy
- **Minimum**: 3-5 examples for complex tasks
- **Classification**: Mix up class order to prevent overfitting
- **Quality over Quantity**: One perfect example beats three mediocre

### 5. Temperature Optimization
Based on Google research:
- **Creative tasks**: 0.7-1.0
- **Reasoning/CoT**: 0.0 (greedy decoding)
- **Classification**: 0.1-0.2
- **Code generation**: 0.0-0.3
