# Implementation Checklist - AI Workflow Upgrade

## Week 1: Immediate Changes ✅

### Day 1-2: Template Setup
- [ ] Save the Quick Start Template somewhere easily accessible
- [ ] Create a "Project Context" document for your current React Native app
- [ ] Practice rewriting one of your recent questions using the template

### Day 3-4: Context Front-loading
- [ ] In your next Claude conversation, start with comprehensive project context
- [ ] Include 2-3 relevant files instead of asking about isolated code snippets
- [ ] Measure: Did you get a better first response?

### Day 5-7: One-Shot Practice
- [ ] Take a current development task
- [ ] Write a comprehensive prompt using templates
- [ ] Compare the result to your usual back-and-forth approach

## Week 2: Workflow Systematization ✅

### Template Library Creation
- [ ] Create 3 prompt templates for your most common scenarios:
  - [ ] Bug investigation
  - [ ] Feature implementation  
  - [ ] Code review/optimization
- [ ] Test each template with a real development task

### Context Management
- [ ] Create a "Living Project Context" document that includes:
  - [ ] Architecture overview
  - [ ] Key file structure
  - [ ] Coding conventions
  - [ ] Current development focus
- [ ] Update it weekly

## Week 3-4: Advanced Techniques ✅

### One-Shot Mastery
- [ ] Practice crafting prompts that eliminate follow-up questions
- [ ] Include error handling requirements in requests
- [ ] Ask for complete, production-ready code

### Tool Optimization
- [ ] In Cursor: Better use of codebase indexing and semantic search
- [ ] In Claude: Include comprehensive project context in system prompts
- [ ] Practice hierarchical context (overview → specifics)

## Quick Assessment Questions

Answer these to track your progress:

### Week 1 Assessment
1. **Context Quality**: On a scale of 1-10, how well does the AI understand your project after your first message?
   - Before: ___/10
   - After: ___/10

2. **Response Quality**: How often do you get implementation-ready code in the first response?
   - Before: ___%
   - After: ___%

3. **Conversation Length**: Average number of back-and-forth messages per problem?
   - Before: ___ messages
   - After: ___ messages

### Week 2 Assessment
1. Do you have standardized templates for common scenarios? ✅/❌
2. Can you provide complete project context in under 2 minutes? ✅/❌
3. Are you getting one-shot solutions for simple tasks? ✅/❌

### Week 4 Assessment
1. Can you onboard the AI to a new project in one prompt? ✅/❌
2. Do you get comprehensive solutions without follow-up questions? ✅/❌
3. Would your workflow impress that interviewer? ✅/❌

## Red Flags to Avoid

Stop yourself if you catch yourself doing these:

- [ ] ❌ Asking "what does this do?" without providing project context
- [ ] ❌ Sharing single lines of code without architectural context
- [ ] ❌ Having more than 3 back-and-forth messages for simple tasks
- [ ] ❌ Re-explaining your project setup in every new conversation
- [ ] ❌ Getting partial solutions that need clarification

## Success Indicators

You're on track when you see:

- [ ] ✅ AI provides comprehensive solutions in first response
- [ ] ✅ Solutions include error handling and edge cases
- [ ] ✅ Code follows your project's patterns without being told
- [ ] ✅ You can solve complex problems in single conversations
- [ ] ✅ New team members ask you about your AI workflow

## Emergency Fixes

If you're struggling, try these immediate fixes:

### If responses are too generic:
- Add more specific project context
- Include relevant code interfaces/types
- Specify your exact tech stack and patterns

### If you're still having long conversations:
- Use the feature implementation template
- Front-load ALL requirements upfront
- Ask for complete, runnable solutions

### If solutions don't fit your architecture:
- Include architectural overview in every prompt
- Show examples of existing code patterns
- Specify integration requirements explicitly

## Measurement Metrics

Track these weekly:

1. **Average conversation length**: ___ messages per problem
2. **First-response success rate**: ___% of problems solved in first AI response
3. **Context setup time**: ___ minutes to establish project context
4. **Solution quality**: ___/10 average rating for completeness
5. **Follow-up questions needed**: ___% of solutions need clarification

## Goal State (3 months)

You'll know you've made it when:

- You can describe any project to AI and get architectural advice
- Complex features are implemented in single conversation threads
- Code reviews happen in one comprehensive prompt/response cycle
- You're teaching other developers your AI workflow
- Interviewers are impressed by your development velocity

## Next Actions

**Right now**:
1. Open your current development task
2. Use the Quick Start Template to rewrite your next AI question
3. Include full project context and 2-3 relevant files
4. Compare the response quality to your usual approach

**This week**:
1. Create your Project Context document
2. Practice one-shot prompts for 3 different scenarios
3. Measure conversation length and response quality

**This month**:
1. Build your complete template library
2. Achieve 80%+ first-response success rate
3. Eliminate most back-and-forth conversations

The interviewer was right - this is a learnable skill that dramatically improves development velocity. Start today!
