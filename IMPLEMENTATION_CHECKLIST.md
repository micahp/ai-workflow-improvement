# AI Workflow Improvement Implementation Checklist

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Start Today)

### 1. Apply State-of-the-Art Prompting Techniques
- [ ] **Role Assignment**: Always start prompts with "You are a [SPECIFIC_EXPERT]..."
- [ ] **Hyper-Specific Context**: Provide 6+ detailed paragraphs of technical context
- [ ] **Structured Output**: Use XML-like tags (`<analysis>`, `<implementation>`, `<edge_cases>`)
- [ ] **Escape Hatches**: Include "If you don't have enough information, ask specific questions"
- [ ] **Few-Shot Examples**: Add 2-3 high-quality input-output examples

### 2. Input Quality Self-Assessment (Allie K. Miller's Core Insight)
- [ ] **Prompt Quality Audit**: Rate each prompt before sending (1-10 scale)
- [ ] **Specificity Check**: Can someone else execute this prompt and get the same result?
- [ ] **Context Completeness**: Have I provided ALL necessary background information?
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Are my expectations measurably clear?

### 3. Use New Template Structure
- [ ] Replace all current prompts with the new State-of-the-Art template
- [ ] Include technical stack details (versions, patterns, constraints)
- [ ] Add architectural context and file structure
- [ ] Define expected output format explicitly

## üìä EVALUATION FRAMEWORK 

### Prompt Quality Metrics (Track These)
- **Context Richness**: 1-10 scale on detail provided
- **Role Clarity**: How specific was the AI persona?
- **Output Structure**: Did I define the expected format?
- **Examples Included**: How many relevant examples provided?
- **Escape Hatches**: Did I handle uncertainty scenarios?

### Success Indicators
- [ ] AI provides complete, runnable code on first attempt
- [ ] Minimal clarification questions needed
- [ ] Solution integrates smoothly with existing codebase
- [ ] Edge cases and error handling included
- [ ] Response follows expected structure exactly

## üîÑ WEEKLY IMPROVEMENT CYCLE

### Monday: Planning & Template Prep
- [ ] Review upcoming coding tasks
- [ ] Prepare comprehensive prompts using new templates
- [ ] Gather all necessary context and examples

### Wednesday: Mid-Week Review
- [ ] Evaluate prompt effectiveness from earlier in week
- [ ] Identify patterns in successful vs. failed prompts
- [ ] Adjust templates based on learnings

### Friday: Weekly Retrospective
- [ ] **Prompt Quality Review**: Which prompts worked best and why?
- [ ] **Input Quality Assessment**: Where was I not specific enough?
- [ ] **Template Refinement**: Update templates based on week's experience
- [ ] **Meta-Prompting**: Use AI to improve underperforming prompts

## üéØ SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES TO IMPLEMENT

### "Manager" Approach Implementation
- [ ] **Technical Stack Documentation**: Create comprehensive context document
- [ ] **Architecture Mapping**: Document data flow, patterns, constraints
- [ ] **Code Pattern Library**: Collect examples of how we write components, APIs, etc.
- [ ] **Error Scenario Catalog**: List common problems and expected solutions

### Structured Output Mastery
- [ ] **XML Tag Standards**: Standardize tags (`<analysis>`, `<implementation>`, `<testing>`)
- [ ] **Code Block Formatting**: Always specify language and include imports
- [ ] **Integration Notes**: Require explanation of how code fits existing architecture
- [ ] **Edge Case Coverage**: Mandate consideration of error scenarios

### Meta-Prompting Integration
- [ ] **Prompt Improvement Sessions**: Weekly use of meta-prompting template
- [ ] **Context Optimization**: Regular refinement of technical context sections
- [ ] **Output Format Evolution**: Continuous improvement of expected formats
- [ ] **Example Collection**: Build library of high-quality prompt examples

## üöÄ ADVANCED IMPLEMENTATION

### Dynamic Context Generation
- [ ] **Project Context Templates**: Pre-written context for each major project
- [ ] **Technology Stack Profiles**: Detailed profiles for React Native, Next.js, etc.
- [ ] **Architecture Decision Records**: Document patterns and constraints
- [ ] **Code Review Standards**: Integrate prompting quality into code reviews

### Evaluation & Iteration
- [ ] **Prompt Performance Tracking**: Spreadsheet with prompt effectiveness ratings
- [ ] **Success Pattern Analysis**: Identify what makes prompts consistently work
- [ ] **Failure Mode Documentation**: Catalog common prompt failures and fixes
- [ ] **Team Knowledge Sharing**: Share effective prompts with team members

### Input Quality vs. Tool Blame Balance
- [ ] **First Assumption**: "If output is poor, my input was unclear"
- [ ] **Specificity Benchmarking**: Compare against examples of ultra-specific prompts
- [ ] **Context Saturation**: Always err on side of too much detail
- [ ] **Intent Clarity**: Make goals and success criteria crystal clear
