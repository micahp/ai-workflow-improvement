• Component name & purpose  
• Public API (functions, endpoints, CLI flags)

1. Ensure audience & toolkit understood.  
2. Surface missing context via clarification.  
3. Organise content using progressive disclosure (overview → detail).  
4. Write in active voice, second person.  
5. Include copy-paste-ready code blocks.
